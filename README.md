# Smog_Dashboard
This project aims to monitor air quality in real-time by detecting key smog-related pollutants, including Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), Ammonia (NH₃), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Carbon Dioxide (CO₂). Using an MQ135 sensor, the system collects data on these pollutants and sends it to ThingSpeak for visualization.
